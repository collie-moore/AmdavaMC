<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I’m Amdava, an DevOps Engineer passionate about GCP, Kubernetes and every cloud!</h1>

👀 I’m interested in everything **GCP, Kubernetes, and Cloud**. 

🌱 I am always learning new technologies but currently putting more efforts on learning **Kubernetes** and **Golang**. 

My career objective in 5 years to come is to be proficient in Kubernetes and golang, especially in building microservices which are mainly deployed in Kubernetes 😊. \

If you are intrested to learn either of these two technologies, lets talk. 

📫 Always available on **amdava@moore.co.ke**

👨‍💻 My personal website is [moore.co.ke](https:moore.co.ke)

⚡ Fun fact to wrap this up: **I am what we call community taught DevOps Engineer 😁  who graduated with Bachelors degree in Anthropology**
